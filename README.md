# Nanobots Single-Site Model/Simulator
A formal model, in 2-dimensional continuous space with discrete time, of feasible nanobots moving in a colloidal environment for the problem of single-site cancer detection and treatment.
Nanobot agents here are inspired by actual nanoparticles which, when in the presence of an external chemical gradient, tend towards areas of higher concentration by means of self-propulsion.

Two variants of the model include (1) the "passive agent model", in which there already exists an endogenous chemical gradient centered at the targeted cancer site that is fixed over time; and (2) the more speculative and dynamic "active agent model", in which agents themselves create and amplify a chemical gradient centered at the targeted cancer site.
